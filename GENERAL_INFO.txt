In this repository are shown data and codes used in our manuscript. All analyses and figures are reproducible by
using these scripts. A general description of them is shown as follows:

post_sims1.R   <- Computes posterior predictions for all datasets shown in Table 1 of the main manuscript, 
                  except for those reported by Camu, et. al. 2008.
post_sims2.R   <- Computes posterior predictions for datasets reported by Camu, et. al. 2008.
post_sims3.R   <- Computes posterior predictions for model in Supplementary Material, Section 4.
loo1.R         <- Figure S1
predictions1.R <- Figure 2 and Figures S2 to S26
PCAs.R         <- Figures 3 and 4, Figures S27 to S29
heatmap.R      <- Figure S30
loo2.R         <- Figure S31
predictions2.R <- Figures S32 to S34

Folder "Stan_models" contains all necessary Stan models used. Subfolder "camu2008" contains Stan models for fitting
datasets reported by Camu, et. al., 2008 and subfolder "temperature" contains Stan model used in Supplementary
Material, Section 4.
